## 🎨 Features

### 📖 Scenario using Json



![example of scenario](eat/document/img/processing.png)



**Json based scenario testing tool(which can have test for functional and non-functional)**

- Transfer/Receiving packets are defined with **Json format**
- The defined Json will encoded to Binary packet, and received binary packet will decoded to Json as well.
- It provides **easy to understand and define** Test Case.
- Internally,it uses java reflection, so **developer doesn’t need consider testing implementation**, just define **Test Scenario**.

### 👫 For Who?
EAT can be used for the following developer who want have regression/load test
- Developer who need Game Server Test
- Developer who need General Server(which communicate with binary packet) Test

### 📃 Report Test Result

The test report will displayed with the following features

- Test result per each Scenario Unit 
- Summary for functional scenario test
- Statistics Information



#### 👍 Succeed

## 👤 Background

### End-point Testing Tool

- **Independence from client program**, server developer can have tests for their function.
- Besides Unit-testing tool, server developer need testing tool which can **test end-point**.
- Even unit function works well, we cannot guarantee that operation of service works properly. (Unit testing is not sufficient condition for full valid serviceoperation)

### Scenario base

- The scenario should **easy to read** for maintenance.
- The scenario should support **integration and regression test**.

### Expand to Load Testing.

- Based on scenario, it can support **load testing**.(ex,Peak test, Stress test and so on)


------

### 🐋 Using Actor model

–EAT is developed based on Actor model. 

–So,it can scaled out through nodes for Load Testing.

## 👫 Communications

Basically, EAT supports communication method such as Strem Socket, Web Socket, RESTful API and JMX with plug-in method.
And if you want add more communication method, you can add it using plugin interface.
